This program PreProStr_ghmm.py is used to apply Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) on the prediction of protein secondary structure.
Input: A test.fasta file, which is used to test the accuracy of the prediction
Output: The prediction of protein secondary structure from the input file 
        The accuracy of every prediction
        The average accuracy for the prediction
Sample Usage: python PreProStr_ghmm.py -i test.fasta -o output.txt
